# rock-paper-scissors-bot
An intelligent Rock-Paper-Scissors bot built to adapt and counter various opponent strategies. Completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python Certification project.


# 🤖 Rock-Paper-Scissors Bot

This is an advanced Rock-Paper-Scissors bot built using Python. The bot analyzes and adapts to different opponent strategies using pattern recognition, frequency analysis, and predictive modeling.

## 🏁 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the [FreeCodeCamp]((https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/Bereketgetaw)) Scientific Computing with Python Certification. The goal was to create a player function that could consistently outperform built-in bots with varying strategies.

## ✅ Features

- Detects and counters hardcoded patterns like Quincy (RRPPS).
- Uses Markov Chains to predict opponents like Abbey.
- Beats reactive opponents like Kris by planning counter-moves.
- Adapts to frequency-based players like Mrugesh.
- Implements fallback logic with randomized yet non-predictable patterns.

## 📊 Sample Results


Final results: {'p1': 797, 'p2': 1, 'tie': 202}
Player 1 win rate: 99.87%
🧠 How It Works
Tracks opponent history and uses it to detect patterns.

Predicts the opponent’s next move based on historical data.

Responds with the optimal move to counter the predicted one.
